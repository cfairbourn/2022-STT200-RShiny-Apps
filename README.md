# 2022-STT200-RShiny-Apps
R-Shiny apps developed for the MSU STT200 Team during the summer of 2022. Developed mostly by myself, based off of apps created by Scott Manski, directed by Camille Fairbourn, with a little assistance from Harrison Adams.

Included are two folders, New Apps and Old Apps. I have since updated my style of coding and organized the file structure of the apps themselves, as well as grouped and categorized the code within them.
